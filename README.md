# Towards Re-Identification for Warehousing Entities
This repository complements our publication "Towards Re-Identification for Warehousing Entities – A Work-in-Progress Study".

The dataset "pallet-block-502", as presented in our publication, as well as the specifications of the camera models that were used can be found here. The dataset is currently hosted by Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e. V.

This work is part of the project "Silicon Economy Logistics Ecosystem" which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.
